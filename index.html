          <h1>What is mobile first design</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          Mobile first design is a design strategy that says when you create a
          website or app, you should start sketching and prototyping the
          smallest screen first and work your way up to larger screens.
          Essentially, it’s about delivering the right user experience to the
          right device.
        </p>

        <p>
          The reason that this makes sense is because with such limited real
          estate on small screens, UX designers must prioritize the most
          important aspects of their website and apps, namely content.
        </p>

        <p>
          For many years, mobile websites were an afterthought to the design
          process. An addition not a necessity. The slow decline of desktop
          coupled with the rise of mobile phones over the last 5 years has shown
          that mobile first design has to take priority.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mobile conversions rates are up 64% when compared with the average
          desktop conversion rates. So designing mobile first can lead to more
          profit for your business. And since Google ranks for
          mobile-friendliness, it makes sense to bear this in mind when starting
          a new project.
        </p>

        <p>
          This way of designing is also beneficial when it comes to download
          times and users accessing your content as quickly as possible. With
          fewer elements, the page will load faster. When you consider a 1
          second delay causing a 7% loss in conversions – it pays to design
          mobile first.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you design from the smallest screen to the largest screen, this
          is known as progressive enhancement. It’s about designing with a
          strong foundation and adding enhancements as you go.
        </p>

        <p>
          With mobile first, you create your strong foundation. This foundation
          will help strengthen other designs for tablet and desktop. The
          foundation should always be content and mobile first design emphasizes
          content over navigation – users get the information they need quicker.
        </p>

        <p>
          This will also make your life easier since mobile first design starts
          off with the tackling the hardest screen size to design for. The rest
          inevitably falls into place.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mobile first design forces you to really focus and maintain clarity by
          removing any unnecessary user interface decoration. By removing any
          distractions, you’ll invariably improve the user experience and that
          makes good business sense.

      <section class="main-section" id="Mobile_first_is_content_first">

          <h1>Mobile first is content first</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          Content takes center stage in mobile first design. With mobile first
          design, you have to give your users the content that they absolutely
          need. Designing this way, with such stringent limitations, forces UX
          designers to strip any extraneous elements away and focus on the
          essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we talk of extraneous elements we don’t mean that they’re not
          necessary – they’re just not necessary for your mobile users. You can
          still use any UI elements you remove from your mobile first design in
          a desktop version, for example.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is because content is context dependent. A mobile user will have
          different needs than a desktop user. A desktop user may be looking for
          more in-depth information or additional features that wouldn’t make
          sense when it comes to mobile first design.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a traditional desktop website, you are more likely to see white
          space whereas collapsible menus and widgets are more prominent in
          mobile sites. The same can be said of photos – expect full size
          imagery on a desktop. We’re talking advertisements and promotional
          material. This sort of imagery will be reduced (or even removed) on
          mobile websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Breakpoints are also important to mention. Normally you would define
          your breakpoints depending on the device.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, when you resize your browser from large to small, you
          will see the presentation of the content change at specific
          breakpoints – these breakpoints are used to change the content to fit
          the device. On our blog, for example, when you resize below 1223
          pixels wide, the content will change to suit the newer size.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach becomes untenable when you consider the vast number of
          mobile devices on the market. Because of this, it’s best to create
          content specific breakpoint. What does that mean? It means creating a
          breakpoint for when the content is no longer easy to consume. The best
          sort of design is one which solves future problems prematurely.

            <h2>Mobile-first = Content-first</h2>
            <p>
              When it comes to mobile-first design, you need to remember one
              thing: Content is key. You need to give your users all the content
              they’re looking for—and only that. Anything else might clutter and
              distract from your users’ experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              After all, designing for mobile devices comes with a big
              constraint in screen sizes. That means you need to take a look at
              all of your content and present it in a visual hierarchy depending
              on how important it is to your user. Only then can you fit the
              most important elements.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Make it easy to navigate</h2>
            <p>
              Condense your secondary elements into easy-to-reach navigational
              buttons. One tried-and-true method of doing this is by using a
              hamburger menu.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hamburger menus are recognizable ways for your user to attain
              access to secondary elements. If you don’t have one on the page
              already, chances are your users know to go to the hamburger menu
              to find what they’re looking for.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>KISS (Keep it simple, stupid)</h2>
            <p>Good mobile design is simple.</p>
            <p>
              You never want to burden your users with extraneous elements like
              ads, pop-ups, and other content they don’t want to see—but
              especially not on mobile. Limit your limited visual real estate to
              only including the things they’re on the page for.
            </p>

          Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3. It uses the @media
          rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition
          is true.
        </p>
        <h2>Example :</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If the browser window is 600px or smaller, the background color
              will be lightblue:
            </p>
            <code>
              @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) { body {
              background-color: lightblue; } }
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              When the screen (browser window) gets smaller than 768px, each
              column should have a width of 100%:
            </p>
            <code>
              /* For desktop: */ .col-1 {width: 8.33%;} .col-2 {width: 16.66%;}
              .col-3 {width: 25%;} .col-4 {width: 33.33%;} .col-5 {width:
              41.66%;} .col-6 {width: 50%;} .col-7 {width: 58.33%;} .col-8
              {width: 66.66%;} .col-9 {width: 75%;} .col-10 {width: 83.33%;}
              .col-11 {width: 91.66%;} .col-12 {width: 100%;} @media only screen
              and (max-width: 768px) { /* For mobile phones: */ [class*="col-"]
              { width: 100%; } }
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Instead of changing styles when the width gets smaller than 768px,
              we should change the design when the width gets larger than 768px.
              This will make our design Mobile First:
            </p>
            <code>
              /* For mobile phones: */ [class*="col-"] { width: 100%; } @media
              only screen and (min-width: 768px) { /* For desktop: */ .col-1
              {width: 8.33%;} .col-2 {width: 16.66%;} .col-3 {width: 25%;}
              .col-4 {width: 33.33%;} .col-5 {width: 41.66%;} .col-6 {width:
              50%;} .col-7 {width: 58.33%;} .col-8 {width: 66.66%;} .col-9
              {width: 75%;} .col-10 {width: 83.33%;} .col-11 {width: 91.66%;}
              .col-12 {width: 100%;} }
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Note that the two sets of classes are almost identical, the only
              difference is the name (col- and col-s-):
            </p>
            <code>
              /* For mobile phones: */ [class*="col-"] { width: 100%; } @media
              only screen and (min-width: 600px) { /* For tablets: */ .col-s-1
              {width: 8.33%;} .col-s-2 {width: 16.66%;} .col-s-3 {width: 25%;}
              .col-s-4 {width: 33.33%;} .col-s-5 {width: 41.66%;} .col-s-6
              {width: 50%;} .col-s-7 {width: 58.33%;} .col-s-8 {width: 66.66%;}

              {width: 91.66%;} .col-s-12 {width: 100%;} } @media only screen and
              (min-width: 768px) { /* For desktop: */ .col-1 {width: 8.33%;}
              .col-2 {width: 16.66%;} .col-3 {width: 25%;} .col-4 {width:

              There are tons of screens and devices with different heights and
              widths, so it is hard to create an exact breakpoint for each
              device. To keep things simple you could target five groups:
            </p>
            <code>
              /* Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down) */ @media only
              screen and (max-width: 600px) {...} /* Small devices (portrait
              tablets and large phones, 600px and up) */ @media only screen and
              (min-width: 600px) {...} /* Medium devices (landscape tablets,
              768px and up) */ @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {...}
              /* Large devices (laptops/desktops, 992px and up) */ @media only
              screen and (min-width: 992px) {...} /* Extra large devices (large
              laptops and desktops, 1200px and up) */ @media only screen and
              (min-width: 1200px) {...}
